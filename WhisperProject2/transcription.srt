 Good job. Glad to see things are going well and business is starting to pick up.

00:00:11,359 --> 00:00:21,960
 Andrea told me about your outstanding numbers on Tuesday. Keep up the good work.

3
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:33,960
 Now to other business, I am going to suggest a payment schedule for the outstanding

4
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:49,359
 money that is due. One, can you pay the balance of the license agreement as soon as possible?

5
00:00:49,359 --> 00:01:02,960
 Two, I suggest we set up or you suggest what you can pay on the back rawties. What do

6
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:27,079
 you feel comfortable with paying every two weeks? Every month. I would like to keep, I

7
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:44,120
 would like to catch up and maintain current royalties. So if we can start current royalties

8
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:55,159
 and maintain them every two weeks as all stores are required to do, I would appreciate it.

9
00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:02,159
 Let me know if this works for you. Thanks.
